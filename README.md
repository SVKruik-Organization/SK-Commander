# SK Commander

Welcome to SK Commander, a sleek & modern desktop app to manage your SK Platform products and accounts. With SK Commander you can tweak advanced settings of Apricaria, manage your Operator team and a lot more. This is the user version of [SK Administrator](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/SK-Administrator).

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation/read/Doc/Community/Support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
